                            <h2>UC Freshmen</h2>
                            <p>As an IT student at University of Cincinnati, I am always eager to learn about changing technologies and different aspects of them. This year I had one of the most turning point experience in my career and academic life. In the starting of my first-year college, I got a job offer from Dr. Hazem Said as a student worker in Information Technology Solutions Center. I never thought that I would get the job because I had no prior experience in technology and even I didn’t want to be in IT program because I had more interest in Mechanical Engineering, but life happens. I thought I would fail working there and would never achieve anything because world is smarter than me. First day at work was so much overwhelming for me because I got to know the whole team and their stories working in the workplace. I was also briefed by Dr. Said regarding software application development cycle. I also got exposed with many different technologies and software which I never heard about. I took part in development operations (DevOps) team which sounds very confusing, but it is fun because I got to learn about both development and system admin world.</p>
                            <p>After the whole one semester working there, I got into system administrator class and I found out that I know ahead of things than the average student in that class. Not only in one class but in my other classes, I was ahead from other in terms of knowledge about that course because I gain so much experience from ITSC that I could’ve easily tested out those classes. I never thought that ITSC would help me to achieve higher grade in my all classes. It not only helped me academically but also improved my soft skills like effective communication, project management, and leadership. I felt so much confident about myself.</p>
                            <p>At the end of first semester, I was ready to set my professional and personal goals because I knew what to expect. I didn’t miss any opportunity in volunteering for any ongoing projects. I scheduled a meeting with Dr. Said and told him about my personal and professional growth goal because I just didn’t want to know just about computers, I wanted to be successful at managing people as well. Dr. Said mentored me throughout the my both semesters of my first-year college and I had a very strong year in IT program. I excelled my classes and as well as working in ITSC.</p>
                            <p>Working in ITSC made me realized that what I want to be in the future. Work experience gave me perfect vision of my dream job. I want to be an IT Solutions Architect because I know that I am good at having great vision for big picture of a project. I want to know more about different technologies so that when I create a plan for any project, I have so many technologies in my tool box, which I can use to create an effective project plan. Also, I love to work around people that are passionate and brings positivity in workplace. This first-year of at UC prepared me for my academic as well as professional career. I feel more confident about myself about learning new aspects.</p>
